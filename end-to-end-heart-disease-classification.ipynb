    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various pyhton based machine learning and data science linraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",

    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",
